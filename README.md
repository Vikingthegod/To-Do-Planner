## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for the development of a Todo Planner website using the MERN stack. This document serves as a reference for the development team and stakeholders to understand the system's features, functionality, and constraints.

### 1.2. Scope
The Todo Planner website aims to provide users with the ability to create and manage their tasks and to-do lists. Users can register, log in, and organize their tasks by categories, priorities, and due dates. The system will also provide reminders for upcoming tasks.

### 1.3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- MERN: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification

### 1.4. References
List any relevant documents, standards, or external references that were used in creating this SRS.

### 1.5. Overview
This document consists of several sections that describe the project's purpose, scope, functional and non-functional requirements, user interfaces, and other relevant information to guide the development of the Todo Planner website.

## 2. Overall Description
### 2.1. Product Perspective
Describe how the Todo Planner website fits into the larger system or ecosystem, if applicable.

### 2.2. Product Functions
The main functions of the Todo Planner website include user registration, task creation and management, category and priority assignment, task reminders, user profile management, and search and filter functionality.

### 2.3. User Classes and Characteristics
Identify and describe the various user roles (e.g., regular users, administrators) and their characteristics.

### 2.4. Operating Environment
Specify the operating environment, including the required hardware and software components.

### 2.5. Design and Implementation Constraints
List any constraints related to design and implementation, such as specific technologies or libraries to be used.

### 2.6. User Documentation
Detail any user documentation that will be provided, such as user manuals or help guides.

### 2.7. Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumptions made during the project and any dependencies on external factors.

## 3. Specific Requirements
### 3.1. External Interfaces
Specify the external interfaces, including user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software interfaces, and communication interfaces.

### 3.2. Functional Requirements
List the functional requirements of the system, including use cases, scenarios, and detailed descriptions of features.

### 3.3. Non-Functional Requirements
Specify the non-functional requirements, including performance, security, and usability requirements.

## 4. System Features
### 4.1. User Registration and Authentication
- Users can register with their email and password.
- Users can log in with their registered credentials.
- User authentication and authorization will be implemented.

### 4.2. Todo List Management
- Users can create and manage multiple to-do lists.
- Each to-do list can have a unique name and description.

### 4.3. Task Creation and Management
- Users can create tasks within their to-do lists.
- Tasks will have titles, descriptions, due dates, and completion status.
- Users can mark tasks as completed or pending.

### 4.4. Task Priority and Categories
- Users can assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to tasks.
- Users can categorize tasks into custom categories.

### 4.5. Task Reminders
- Users can set reminders for tasks, including date and time reminders.
- Users will receive notifications for upcoming tasks.

### 4.6. User Profile Management
- Users can edit their profile information, including name, profile picture, and password.

### 4.7. Search and Filter Functionality
- Users can search for tasks by title, description, or category.
- Users can filter tasks by priority, due date, and completion status.

## 5. External Interface Requirements

- Describe the layout and design of user interfaces.

### 5.2. Hardware Interfaces
- Specify any hardware requirements, if applicable.

### 5.3. Software Interfaces
- List any external software components or APIs that the system will interact with.

### 5.4. Communication Interfaces
- Describe how the system will communicate with external services or systems.

## 6. Quality Attributes
### 6.1. Usability
- The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.

### 6.2. Reliability
